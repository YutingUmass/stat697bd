Notes:
1. Folder "weak", "mild", "strong" are the simulated data.
2. Folder "result_dataframe" is the data of the result generated for each size ratio.
3. Folder "result_plot" contains the code and the results of visualization.
4. File "Simulations.ipynb" is a tidy and combined version of the final code.
5. FIle "data_sim2_generation.Rmd" is the code for data simulation.
6. Files named as "result_sim2_ratio_1_*_rjc.ipynb" are the raw code to run the test results for different size ratios.
